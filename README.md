# bmi_calculator

This is a bmi calculator build with Flutter bloc that takes the Gender, Weight in Kilograms, Height in centimeters, and age
then returns the bmi with a basic description.

## Getting Started

This project makes use of the fitness calculator API to
calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI). (https://rapidapi.com/malaaddincelik/api/fitness-calculator/)

The project automatically detects the connection state which enables the bmi button available to be made for 
calculation.
